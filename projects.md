## Recruiting

I am looking for research assistants for ongoing projects in AI-enhanced battery modeling and energy storage systems. Compensation is competitive and aligned with institutional standards.

### Available Research Assistant Projects

- Predictive modeling of battery degradation using deep learning  
- Integration of electrochemical simulations with machine learning  
- Scalable energy storage system feasibility analysis  
- Visualization tools for state-of-health tracking  

If you're interested, please contact: [toby@toby-huang.com](mailto:toby@toby-huang.com)

## Student Projects

Supervision is available for thesis, final-year, and summer projects related to battery lifetime prediction, AI modeling, and sustainable energy systems. Students are encouraged to propose topics or join existing efforts.
