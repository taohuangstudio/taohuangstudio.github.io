I lead a cross-disciplinary research and deployment program that tightly couples electrochemical insight, artificial intelligence, and practical system implementation to accelerate scalable energy storage in emerging markets. My research interests lie at the intersection of AI-enhanced battery degradation forecasting, data-physics hybrid modeling, and large-scale energy infrastructure deployment. I develop methodologies that extract maximal predictive power from limited early-cycle data to forecast specific capacity trajectories and long-term performance, while integrating large language models as generative and interpretive tools to explore, propose, and parameterize novel electrode and cell geometries.

Currently I am directing a flagship energy storage deployment project in Indonesia, overseeing the technical design, localized production roadmap, and financial-technical integration required to realize resilient, high-cycle-life battery systems. This effort combines system-level feasibility, supply chain localization, and AI-informed performance targeting to ensure sustainable and cost-effective scale-up.

Methodologically, my work spans convolutional and ensemble machine learning architectures with uncertainty quantification, physics-informed constraints, and interactive LLM-driven design workflows that translate qualitative electrochemical phenomena into quantitative simulation inputs. I collaborate with engineers, data scientists, and regional implementation partners to bridge the gap between conceptual models and operational systems.

My outputs include model frameworks, deployment strategies, and tools shared with the broader research community, and have been propagated through peer-reviewed publications, open-source releases, and institutional collaborations.
